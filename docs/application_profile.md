# DLME Application Profile and Schema Mapping

## Assumptions for initial prototype

* DLME needs to aggregate data about cultural heritage objects sourced from
multiple institutions using various schemas into a common index
* Any application profile, model, used etc. for DLME should be based on a
preexisting application profile, and document any needed divergences
* For the prototype phase, any downstream publication or production of RDF
should be considered secondary
* Subsequently, context classes may not be applicable if data is only available
as literals

## Common / Current Data Models to DLME Application Profile Mappings

* Schemas are selected based on their appearance in [this GH repo](https://github.com/waynegraham/dlme-metadata) containing metadata for batch loading
* Notes and some basic analysis of data for mapping purposes is in [this Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sp7uMHizVX7xN7xN9mm-vgEuESQBovXO-qenAo_TV-w/edit?usp=sharing) (the mappings are then migrated here for review / completion)

## Application profile

The DLME Prototype Application Profile a subset of the [Europeana Data Model](http://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/data-guidelines/edm-documentation).
Currently, the Application Profile only focuses on implementation of EDM's core
classes (i.e. `ore:Aggregation`, `edm:ProvidedCHO`, and `edm:WebResource`), plus
the [EDM Profile for IIIF](http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Share_your_data/Technical_requirements/EDM_profiles/IIIFtoEDM_profile_042016.pdf).
