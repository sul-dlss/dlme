      "<p><span style=\"font-size:14pt;font-family:'times new roman', times;\"><strong>Episode 69: Educational Transitions in Post-Revolutionary Spaces: Islam, Security, and Social Movements in Tunisia</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:12pt;\">In this podcast, <a href=\"https://www.luc.edu/education/about/faculty/julestavisd.shtml\">Dr. Tavis D. Jules</a> is interviewed on his recent book, <em><a href=\"https://ecommons.luc.edu/facultybooks/136/\">Educational Transitions in Post-Revolutionary Spaces : Islam, Security and Social Movements in Tunisia</a></em>, co-authored with Dr. Teresa Barton. Jules and Barton trace the development of Tunisia’s educational system to the 2010/2011 contestatory events that led to the Tunisian Revolution and embarked on a period of large-scale institutional reform, including education sector reform. This post-Revolutionary reform has primarily been concerned with providing young Tunisian citizens with the necessary skills for a rapidly changing job market.  In his presentation, Jules engages with the issue of how a strong educational system produced generations of educated citizens, but whose most recent generation is frustrated by a weakened socio-economic system unable to absorb a young and educated workforce.  The book itself traces the history and evolution of Tunisia’s educational system since independence in 1956 to the contemporary period,  and ties its analysis to an « educational transitologies framework ». Through several chapters, the book engages and explores themes related to education, including security, gender, political Islam and social movements and analyses these comparatively pre- and post-political transition which commenced in 2011. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:12pt;\">In this podcast, Dr. Jules was invited to answer a number of questions touching upon the following themes : </span></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align:justify;\"><li><span style=\"font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:12pt;\">Definition of the concept of conscientization and its importance to understand the role of education.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:12pt;\">The common link that the book draws between education and Islam, security and social movements. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:12pt;\">The book’s methodology to study 'educational transitologies' and what the example of Tunisia tells us about this theoretical framework. </span></li>\n</ul><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:12pt;\">Dr. Tavis D.
